# FriendFinder
![Homepage](/images/home.png)

## Intro
This is an app utilizing Node and Express. 
We form a server that allows us to make matches between friends using a survey format. 

### Use
The local host is 4000 and can be activated in the repository via the terminal with the command: node server.js.

When the survey is completed a log of the current friend list in the server is displayed as shown above. 
The matched friend is then displayed in a window.

After I matched with Lando, the survey entry is added to the JSON list of all of the friends in the server.

This keeps a log of the friends in the database.
